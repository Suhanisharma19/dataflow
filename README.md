DataFlow - Data Structure Visualizer 🚀
Welcome to DataFlow, an interactive platform to learn, visualize, and experiment with fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms!
Here, you can input your own data or generate random datasets and see step-by-step how structures behave under different operations and algorithms — with code highlights and theoretical explanations side by side.

🌟 Features
Enter your own arrays or randomly generate them.

Beautiful visualizations of each operation with highlighted code.

Step-by-step animations for better understanding.

View both theory and working of each algorithm/structure.

Search, Insert, Delete operations included wherever applicable.
